# Muhammad Nuzul Mahfiruddin Syah Dema - Data Scientist

Hello, I'm Nuzul. Welcome to my GitHub profile.

## About Me

As a Geodesy graduate, my coding journey began with automating satellite image processing and map creation, sparking a passion for data-driven solutions. This led to a masterâ€™s in Geoinformatics and completing the Hacktiv8 Data Science bootcamp.

Proficient in Python, SQL, Tableau, and machine learning models, I bring a strong technical foundation and unique geospatial perspective to deliver actionable insights for organizations.

## Highlight Projects:
- **ETL Pipeline E-commerce Logistics**: Streamlines the process of retrieving daily data from a PostgreSQL database into centralized Elasticsearch database with ETL pipeline. It also ensures the data is consistently preprocessed and standardized for visualization. It used Python, Airflow, Pandas, ElasticSearch, Kibana, and PostgreSQL.
- **DL Classification, Suitable Product Types Recommendation**: Simplifies product categorization in the marketplace by leveraging a deep learning classification model to analyze user-entered descriptions. It achieved 94% accuracy. It used Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow.
- **ML Classification, Fixed Deposit Offer Acceptance Prediction**: Enhance the efficiency of fixed deposit offering by using a machine learning classification model to predict whether a customer is likely to accept the offer when contacted. It achieved 65% precision score. It used Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-Learn.
